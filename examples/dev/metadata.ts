/**
 * @title Retrieve chain metadata
 * @stability unstable â€“ We'll likely restructure the metadata such that we can use its type signature
 * within a type utility to produce constraints over calls and events.
 * Tracked in [881](https://github.com/paritytech/capi/issues/811).
 *
 * The chain's metadata (formally-termed "FRAME Metadata") describes all of its runtime properties,
 * including storage, constants, callables, their types and even plain-text descriptions.
 * This metadata serves as the basis off of which we generate chain-specific APIs. Unless you are
 * building an advanced Capi-based library, chances are that you don't need to work with the metadata directly.
