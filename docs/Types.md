# Types

The types of the on-chain world are declared in a given
[Substrate](https://substrate.io/)-based chain's (Rust) source code. While many
types may remain consistent across chains, many may differ. On one chain,
`AccountData` may be defined with fields describing fungible assets; on another
(hypothetical) chain, perhaps `AccountData` references non-fungible assets,
reputation, linked accounts or something else entirely. Although
[FRAME](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/glossary/#frame) certainly helps to
standardize chain properties, those properties can be customized to the extent
that we cannot make assumptions regarding shapes of data across chains.
Additionally, types can change upon
[runtime upgrades](https://docs.substrate.io/build/upgrade-the-runtime/); your
assumptions about the shape of a type may become invalid; to interact with these
highly-dynamic on-chain environments––and to do so from a JavaScript
environment––poses inherent difficulty. We JS developers must (A) think in terms
of Rust data types and (B) keep a lookout for breaking changes to chain
runtimes. This document does not provide a silver-bullet solution to this
complexity, but it should provide the background necessary for you to address
types for your specific use cases.

If you just want to see how Rust types are transformed by Capi,
[skip to the conversion table](#rust-⬌-typescript).

## Learning About Types

Let's cover how to learn about a chain's types/properties.

<!-- ### [capi.dev](https://capi.dev/) -->

### FRAME Metadata

Every FRAME chain exposes metadata about its types and capabilities. This
metadata is called the "FRAME Metadata." Let's retrieve and inspect it.

```ts
import { client } from "http://localhost:4646/frame/wss/rpc.polkadot.io/@v0.9.36/mod.ts"
```

> To run the Capi dev server, run `deno run -A https://deno.land/x/capi/main.ts`

Let's connect to Polkadot and fetch the chain's metadata for the present highest
block.

```ts
// ...

const metadata = await C.metadata(client)()

console.log(await metadata.run())
```

If we index into `metadata.pallets`, we'll see a list of all pallet metadata.
Each element of this list contains a complete description of the given pallet's
storage entries, as well as constants, callables (for creating extrinsics),
errors and events. Some fields––such as a pallet's `call` field––point to an
index in `metadata.tys`, which contains a complete description of the chain's
type-level context.

Let's say we want to learn about the types associated with the `Balances`
pallet's `Account` storage.

```ts
// ...

const balancesPallet = C.palletMetadata(metadata, "Balances")

const accountsStorage = C.entryMetadata(balancesPallet, "Account")

console.log(await accountsStorage.run())
```

On chains using the `Balances` pallet, `accountsStorage` will look _similar_ to
the following.

```ts
{
  name: "Account",
  modifier: "Default",
  type: "Map",
  hashers: [ "Blake2_128Concat" ],
  key: {
    id: 0,
    path: [ "sp_core", "crypto", "AccountId32" ],
    params: [],
    type: "Struct",
    fields: [ { name: undefined, ty: [ ... ], typeName: "[u8; 32]", docs: [ ... ] } ],
    docs: []
  },
  value: {
    id: 5,
    path: [ "pallet_balances", "AccountData" ],
    params: [ { name: "Balance", ty: [ ... ] } ],
    type: "Struct",
    fields: [
      { name: "free", ty: [ ... ], typeName: "Balance", docs: [ ... ] },
      { name: "reserved", ty: [ ... ], typeName: "Balance", docs: [ ... ] },
      { name: "misc_frozen", ty: [ ... ], typeName: "Balance", docs: [ ... ] },
      { name: "fee_frozen", ty: [ ... ], typeName: "Balance", docs: [ ... ] }
    ],
    docs: []
  },
  default: Uint8Array(64) [ 0, 0, 0, ... ],
  docs: [ ... ]
}
```

- `type` tells us that this storage is that of a map, not a plain entry
  (standalone value)
- `key` tells us what type of value(s) we need to use in order to index into the
  map
- `value` tells us what type of value we can expect to retrieve from the map

In this example, the `key`'s `id` is `0`. Let's take a look at this type (within
the top-level `metadata`'s `tys`).

```ts
const keyType = metadata.tys[accountsStorage.key]
```

`keyType` should evaluate to something along the lines of:

```ts
{
  i: 0,
  path: ["sp_core", "crypto", "AccountId32"],
  params: [],
  type: "Struct",
  fields: [{ name: undefined, ty: 1, typeName: "[u8; 32]", docs: [] }],
  docs: [],
};
```

If we index again into `metadata.tys` with `1` (as specified in the first
field), we'll see the inner types (in this case a 32-element tuple of `u8`s).
From these descriptions, we can roughly deduce the JS equivalent.

```ts
namespace sp_core {
  export namespace crypto {
    export type AccountId32 = Uint8Array
  }
}
```

We can instantiate this as we would any other JS-land value.

```ts
const accountId32 = new Uint8Array(RAW_ADDR_BYTES)
```

We'll cover the TypeScript <-> Rust conversions more in depth
[in a later section](#typescript---rust).

Let's now utilize our `accountId32` definition to read a balance.

```ts
// ...

const key = C.keyPageRead(client)("System", "Account", 1, [])
  .access(0)
  .access(0)

const account = C.entryRead(client)("System", "Account", [key])

const account = await account.run()
```

What value does this retrieve? How can we deduce this from the FRAME metadata?

We can do the same as before, but this time index into `metadata.tys` with the
`accountsStorage.value`.

```ts
const valueType = metadata.tys[accountsStorage.value]
```

This should give us something along the following lines:

```ts
{
  i: 5,
  path: ["pallet_balances", "AccountData"],
  params: [{ name: "Balance", ty: 6 }],
  type: "Struct",
  fields: [
    { name: "free", ty: 6, typeName: "Balance", docs: [] },
    { name: "reserved", ty: 6, typeName: "Balance", docs: [] },
    { name: "misc_frozen", ty: 6, typeName: "Balance", docs: [] },
    { name: "fee_frozen", ty: 6, typeName: "Balance", docs: [] },
  ],
  docs: [],
};
```

When we follow type `6` (metadata.tys[6]), we see that it represents a `u128`.
In TypeScript, this translates to a `bigint`. Therefore, the complete JS-land
structure looks as follows.

```ts
namespace pallet_balances {
  export interface AccountData {
    free: bigint
    reserved: bigint
    miscFrozen: bigint
    feeFrozen: bigint
  }
}
```

> Note: we can ignore the `params` field of the `AccountData` metadata, as the
> type param is already applied to the field metadata.

## Runtime Validation

What happens if we ever specify an invalid value to an untyped effect? Capi will
return a validation error with a detailed description of the type
incompatibility.

For instance, the aforementioned system accounts map is keyed with a
`Uint8Array`. What happens if we try to key into it with `"HELLO T6"`?

```ts
const account = C.entryRead(client)("System", "Account", ["HELLO T6"])

console.log(await account.run())
```

This will produce the following error:

```ts
ScaleAssertError: !(value[0] instanceof Uint8Array)
    < ... stacktrace ... >
```

---

Let's look at the same example from before: reading some `AccountData`.

## Discriminating "Ok" from "Error"

```ts
const result = await C.entryRead(client)("System", "Account", [key]).run()
```

In this storage read example, `result` is typed as the successfully-retrieved
value (container) unioned with all possible errors.

There are several ways to "unwrap" the inner `value`. The recommended path is to
first check for and handle all possible errors, which may encapsulate error
specific data (as do [SCALE](https://github.com/paritytech/scale-ts) validation
errors).

```ts
if (account instanceof Error) {
  // Handle errors here.
} else {
  account.value // `unknown`
}
```
